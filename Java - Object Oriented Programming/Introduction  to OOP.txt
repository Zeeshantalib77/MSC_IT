The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language. 
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts, 
such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism, etc. 
The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities, for example, object, classes, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
The popular object-oriented languages are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc.


Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. 
Object-Oriented Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. 
It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts: Object, Class, Inheritance, 
Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.

Object: Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc. It can be physical or logical. 
Example: A dog is an object because it has states like color, name, breed, etc. as well as behaviors like wagging the tail, barking, eating, etc.

Class: Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity. 
A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.
